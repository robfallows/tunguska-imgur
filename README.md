# tunguska:imgur

An ES2015 Meteor OAuth handler package for Imgur.

If you want to use it "as is" you can just `meteor add tunguska:imgur`

This is mainly to aid in understanding the mechanics of putting together an OAuth handler for any arbitrary provider.

The trickier parts of the codebase are (hopefully) annotated well enough to comprehend what's going on in this bit of Meteor Magic.

There's an accompanying blog article [here]() which should be read prior to forking and hacking!

Enjoy :smile:
